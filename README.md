This repository contains a case study submission for the Nation Building Case Study Competition (Nation with Namo). The case study, conducted by a team from the Indian Institute of Technology, Indore, focuses on addressing two critical aspects of Indiaâ€™s education sector:

Increasing the Gross Enrollment Ratio (GER) to 75% by 2047.
Developing 100 World-Class Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) by 2047.

Key Solutions Proposed:

Addressing Financial Barriers: Encouraging part-time/freelance work culture among students to reduce financial pressure.
Institutional Policies: Implementing policies such as flexible working hours and single-shift timings to support students in balancing work and education.
Hybrid Learning Models: Promoting a combination of online and offline education to optimize resources and increase accessibility, particularly in rural areas.
Mass Education Campaigns: Introducing initiatives like "SankalpSiksha" to raise awareness about the importance of higher education and drive enrollment.
Industry-Academia Collaboration: Encouraging partnerships between industries and academic institutions to enhance R&D capabilities and improve job readiness.
